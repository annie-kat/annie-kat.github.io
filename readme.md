Notes on client-side routing: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing
GitHub Pages doesnâ€™t support routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router using browserHistory). 
Alternatives:
1. use hashHistory
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46016415/wheres-hashhistory-in-react-router-v4 says:
    "Use a HashRouter. They got rid of individual histories such as browserHistory and hashHistory and instead replaced them with BrowserRouter and HashRouter components respectively in React Router v4"

2. use 404.html to redirect
